## 📄 Abstract
This document outlines the technical specifications for **ColorIsLive**, a persistent virtual environment built upon a **24-bit RGB Spatial Indexing System**.

Developed by **ColorIsLive Labs**, this protocol utilizes a finite coordinate system (16,777,216 plots) ensuring:
1.  **Hard-Capped Scarcity** (Proven by RGB limit).
2.  **O(1) Database Speed** (No R-Trees, direct hashing).
3.  **Algorithmic Entropy** (Assets decay without maintenance).
